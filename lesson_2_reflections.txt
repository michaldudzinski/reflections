What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to
do it?

It initializes the repository without making any commits.
You have to make one. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and 
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Files in the staging area are pending to be added from the 
working directory to the repository via commit. It allowes 
you to select particular files instead of commiting 
every single one.
