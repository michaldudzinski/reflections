What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to
do it?

It initializes the repository without making any commits.
You have to make one. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and 
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Files in the staging area are pending to be added from the 
working directory to the repository via commit. It allowes 
you to select particular files instead of commiting 
every single one.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one 
commit per logical change?

You add the components you want to be changed to the 
staging area and then when commiting it only applies the
files you added.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It literally shows how it looks. Of course if there were 
countless branches it would impossible to draw a diagram
but the plain example is enough to understand the concept.

What is the result of merging two branches together?
Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is a merged content of the files merged.
It is represented by a diagram so it is easy to understand
and comprehend.
